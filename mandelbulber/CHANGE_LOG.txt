- added xenodreambuie's fractal formula (http://www.fractalforums.com/3d-fractal-generation/true-3d-mandlebrot-type-fractal/msg8246/#msg8246)
- more accurate calculation of new view-point position after "zoom by click"

- removed limitaions for size of env-map texture and light-map textures (was 512x512)
- all parameters for IFS symetry vectors can be also animated using key-frames
- fixed bug: exp10(x) function was implemented as pow(x,10) - should be pow(10,x) - wrong calculation of fog distance and depth of field focus

v0.72
- added undo and redo buttons (100 levels of undo)
- undo buffer in saved in files and is available after restarting the program
- fixed bug: IFS_distance parameter was not saved and loaded
- fixed bug: missed libpng-14-14.dll in package for Windows
- fixed bug: backgroud image disappeared when close-up was lower than 1e-10

v0.71

- fixed bug: start_frame and end_frame parameters weren't refreshed in edit fields after loading parameters
